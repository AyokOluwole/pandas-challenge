In this challenge, I am the new Chief Data Scientist helping the school 
board and the mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school 
budgets and priorities. Using Jupyter notebook, data manipulation was easy 
as it allowed me to see each result and help make decisions/analyses based 
on those results. From the results, Charter did exceptionally well in each 
category outdoing the Districts schools. Most notably, the % Overall 
Passing with Charter is at 90.432244 and Districts is at 53.672208. Aside 
from that, the top 5 Highest-Performing Schools are all Charter while the 
lowest are all Districts. When we compare the "Spending Ranges (Per 
Student)", the smaller/medium-sized schools (Charter) have less and still 
performed better than the larger-sized schools. Also, each school did 
better regarding the % Passing Reading as it was higher than the % Passing 
Math, which was consistently low across each metric.
